# codeforces
My solutions to some Codeforces problems coded during my spare time mainly to learn a bit of C and actively implement data structures, as well as general problem solving techniques. My handle is `friedrich_hayek`.

The language I used to solve the problems is GNUC11. Last problem added: The Two Routes.

Note: As of 2023-05-28 there are 603 solutions.
